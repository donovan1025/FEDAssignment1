# FEDAssignment1
This is my FED Assignment project.
Project Theme : Coldplay Band Website
The website is dedicated to fans who want to buy merch, buy upcoming concert tickets and see old photos and albums of the band.
The website is created for a band called Coldplay, a huge band who are very popular for their amazing looking concerts.
This project will help to create essential pages for fans who want to get to know more of Coldplay and check out on their latest concert dates.

Design Process:
Many new fans of Coldplay would want to listen to their old albums, with my project it will give fans easier access to their old albums if they do not know the names of certain songs

User stories:
- As I have just started listening to Coldplay songs I want to get to know them better.
- I heard Coldplay just released their new album! But what is the album called?
- I want to buy some merchandise from Coldplay, it is winter season and I heard they have some winter clothing.
- Coldplay are having a concert in Asia! I hope they are coming to Singapore! I need a quicker way to check that.
